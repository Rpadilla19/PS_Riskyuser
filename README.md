# PS_Riskyuser
The purpose of the script is to use mg-graph to pull any users labeled as 'high-risk', sign in counts and entry logs.

How to use
  The script has two versions, one for delegated access and the other has an interactive log-in. In my use case we loaded the script on a raspberry pi to run weekly to audit users. For interactive log-in make sure you are signed in to the proper account and have the proper permissions to access the necessary modules.
